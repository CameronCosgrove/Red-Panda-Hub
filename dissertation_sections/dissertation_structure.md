# Dissertation 
### Quantifying habitat change of the red panda (_Ailurus Fulgens_)

# Summary 
Habitat loss has consistently been identified as the largest threat facing the endangered red panda. The species low dispersal capabilities, arboreal lifestyle, and narrow distribution also make red pandas particularly susceptible to reproductive isolation cause by habitat fragmentation. For the first time, this dissertation quantifies the extent of habitat loss across the red pandas entire range, and identifies possible new isolated sub populations. My results estimate an area of XXX km2 of forest habitat has been lost since 2000 - 2018. The XXX area and the YYY area show the most pronounced forest loss. Rates of forest loss are /increasing/decreasing/country-dependant. No countries show a net increase in forest from 2000 - 2012 in red panda habitat. Protected areas sufficiently/insufficiently protect forest. The forest network in red panda habitat is likely fragmented into X isolated populations, X of which were unknown prior to this study. The conservation implications of this work are...

### 1.1 Red panda ecology
### 1.2 Threats and current conservation efforts 
### 1.3 Project Rationale 
### 1.4 Research questions and hypotheses
RQ1: How is the area of red panda habitat changing?

H1: The area of red panda habitat will have decreased by over 5% from 2000 to 2018.
H10: There is less than 5% forest loss in the area of red panda habitat from 2000 to 2018.

H2: The magnitude and rate of red panda habitat loss will be different in different parts of its range. 
H20: The magnitude and rate of red panda habitat loss will not be  different in different parts of its range. 

H3: Red panda habitat in protected areas will show the least forest loss from 2000-1018

RQ2: How connected is red panda habitat? 

H1: Red pandas are likely separated into more than three isolated sub populations.
H10: Red pandas are isolated into three sub populations.





- Fragmentaion and landuse change are large drivers of global ecosystem change
- Community responses are complex but indivdual responses can be inferred more simply 
- Red Panda ecology make them particularly supceptable to bad impact of fragmentation and habitat loss 
- Remote sensing can be used to quantify fragmentaion and land use change for red pandas 

# Methods 
### 2.1 Defining the study area
The distubution of red pandas... 
Red Panda MaxEnt distrubution 
Can easily recreate my own Feature collection using polygons and the MaxEnt map. I wil start this on monday 
### 2.2 Data collection 
Justification of methods 
- What can be resonably inferred about actual on the ground change using the GEE and pre processed data products?
Explict methods 
- Forest cover calculation
A reletive measure is needed to easily compare areas. Aggregate loss every year relative to 2000 forest cover 



Forest gain is only measured up to 2013. Give an aggregate loss:gain ratio for 2000 - 2013 to indicate level of net change distubance. Not much land abandoment I think in this region. 

Percentage regrowth is also needed to interpreate results. Regrowth would happen for natraul area distubance from 2000 to ~2005. This can be interpretaded as the amound of loss which is natural. This would assume that all human disturbance was permanent. (Is this needed? If forest is losted, no matter if it regrows, it still counts as loss of suitable habitat for red pandas from 2000-2018.)
