### Quantifying habitat change of the red panda (_Ailurus Fulgens_)

# Summary 
Habitat loss has consistently been identified as the largest threat facing the red panda. Red pandas are also particularly susceptible to habitat fragmentation due to their arboreal lifestyle and low dispersal capabilities. For the first time, this dissertation quantifies the extent of habitat loss and fragmentation across the red pandas entire range. My results estimate an area of XXX km2 of forest habitat has been lost since 2000 - 2018. The XXX area and the YYY area show the most pronounced forest loss. Rates of forest loss are increasing/decreasing/country-dependant. No countries show a net increase in forest from 2000 - 2012 in red panda habitat. Protected areas sufficiently/insufficiently protect forest. As of 2000, the forest network in red panda habitat was fragmented into X isolated populations. The conservation implications of this work are...

# Intro 

- Fragmentaion and landuse change are large drivers of global ecosystem change
- Community responses are complex but indivdual responses can be inferred more simply 
- Red Panda ecology make them particularly supceptable to bad impact of fragmentation and habitat loss 
- Remote sensing can be used to quantify fragmentaion and land use change for red pandas 

### Objectives 
### Hypothesis 

## Methods 
### Google Earth Engine 

Justification of methods 
- What can be resonably inferred about actual on the ground change using the GEE and pre processed data products?

Explict methods 
- Forest cover calculation
A reletive measure is needed to easily compare areas. Aggregate loss every year relative to 2000 forest cover 



Forest gain is only measured up to 2013. Give an aggregate loss:gain ratio for 2000 - 2013 to indicate level of net change distubance. Not much land abandoment I think in this region. 

Percentage regrowth is also needed to interpreate results. Regrowth would happen for natraul area distubance from 2000 to ~2005. This can be interpretaded as the amound of loss which is natural. This would assume that all human disturbance was permanent. (Is this needed? If forest is losted, no matter if it regrows, it still counts as loss of suitable habitat for red pandas from 2000-2018.)
