## Intro 

- Fragmentaion and landuse change are large drivers of global ecosystem change
- Community responses are complex but indivdual responses can be inferred more simply 
- Red Panda ecology make them particularly supceptable to bad impact of fragmentation and habitat loss 
- Remote sensing can be used to quantify fragmentaion and land use change for red pandas 

### Objectives 
### Hypothesis 

## Methods 
### Google Earth Engine 

Justification of methods 
- What can be resonably inferred about actual on the ground change using the GEE and pre processed data products?

Explict methods 
- Forest cover calculation
- Fragmentation details 
- Land cover classification 
- What can be resonably inferred about actual on the ground change?
