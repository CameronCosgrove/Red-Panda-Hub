# Red-Panda-Hub

### Welcome!
#### This is my repo for my 4th year dissertation project at the University of Edinburgh. This repo currently functions as a place to store and back up my work. Once the dissertaion is complete the repo will be made public and will hold the final dissertaion, code, and materials used. 

Repository structure:

- [Draft dissertaion sections.](./draft_dissertaion_sections)
- [Google Earth Engine code and files.](./google_earth_engine)
- [R code (models, data manipulation, data visulisation)](./R)
- [Images](./images)


My workflow can be view in the [projects](https://github.com/CameronCosgrove/Red-Panda-Hub/projects) section.
